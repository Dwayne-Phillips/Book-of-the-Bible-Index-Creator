Tools to create chapter:verse index of words for books of the Bible

# The Desire

One of the things I recently discovered was how difficult it was to created an Index for one single book of the Bible. 
For example, "list all the places in the Gospel of Matthew that the world 'Galilee' appears." Simple, right? Wrong.
I had to open a copy of Matthew in a word processor, search for "Galilee," and manually type each chapter:verse where "Galilee" appeared.
While this is not an impossible task, being a computing person I figured, "There must be a simpler way."
Well, I couldn't find a simpler way, so being a computer programmer, or I used to be a computer programmer, I will write a simple way.
This is the result of writing a computer program to make this simpler.

# The End
